# actions-github-app-token

A GitHub Action that generates a GitHub App Installation Token.

## Motivation

There are several ways to use tokens in GitHub Actions.
However, they have some limitations.

- [`secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN`](https://help.github.com/en/actions/configuring-and-managing-workflows/authenticating-with-the-github_token)
  - It has some limitations such as [not being able to triggering a new workflow from another workflow](https://github.community/t5/GitHub-Actions/Triggering-a-new-workflow-from-another-workflow/td-p/31676).
- [Personal Access Tokens (PATs)](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/keeping-your-account-and-data-secure/creating-a-personal-access-token)
  - PATs allow to access all repositories the user can access.
  - It's too much authority for using in GitHub Actions workflows.
- [GitHub Apps](https://docs.github.com/en/developers/apps/getting-started-with-apps/about-apps)
  - There are [some actions that generate installation tokens](#related-works).
  - You can limit the repositories an app can access, but if you own a lot of repositories, you need to manage multiple apps.

The action provides [the GitHub Token Vending API](./provider) to manage token permissions.

## Usage

### Install the GitHub App

Create a new your own GitHub App, or install [My Demonstration App](https://github.com/apps/shogo82148-slim).

### Deploy the GitHub Token Vending API

[Install the AWS SAM CLI](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/serverless-application-model/latest/developerguide/serverless-sam-cli-install.html),
and deploy the API to your AWS Account.

```
cd provider/
sam build
sam deploy
```

### Use the Action in Your Workflow

```yaml
jobs:
  job:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    # use GitHub Actions OIDC Token (Experimental) https://github.com/github/roadmap/issues/249
    permissions:
      id-token: write
      contents: read

    steps:
      - id: generate
        uses: shogo82148/actions-github-app-token@v0
        # Optional (defaults to My Demonstration App).
        # with:
        #   provider-endpoint: https://EXAMPLE.execute-api.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/
      - run: |
          gh issue create --title "Do something using GITHUB_TOKEN"
        env:
          GITHUB_TOKEN: ${{ steps.generate.outputs.token }}
```
